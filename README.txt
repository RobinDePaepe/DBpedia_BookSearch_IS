#Use
The Exam Project notebook makes use of the DBpedia API to harvest elementary metadata of the books found in
the DBpedia database.
Simply type in the books you would like to search for and the code block should return the found result.
A couple of links have been provided for metadata that is considered relevant to search through.

If multiple books have been found, simple type the number of the place where the needed book is listed in.


#DEPENDENCIES
all necessary libraries have been implemented in the notebook. make sure the 'DB_functions.py' file remains in the same map as the notebook.
It is possible that the xmltodict module still needs to be installed on your device, if so, please execute the code block above the #MAIN code block.
